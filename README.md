The app is an MVP of an online Peer-to-Peer marketplace, for hosting outdoor activities.

At the moment Users can browse through the listings, sign up / log in, update their profile photo, and apply to become a host.

Approved hosts can do all of the above plus create their own listings.

To become a host Users need to fill out the 'Become a host' form. After that, they will receive an email letting them know that their application was successful. And then, the Outxplore team reviews the application and notifies the User accordingly.

Once a User is approved they can then create their own listings.

### To do in the future

- Host contact information
- Wishlist
- Listing search
- Testing
- Do you have any ideas?

#### The frontend of the app is built with React and Redux, and the backend is an API built with Ruby on Rails
